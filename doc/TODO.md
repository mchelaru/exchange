# A very incomplete list of TODO items

 * IPv4 is assumed everywhere. Adding IPv6 should be a low hanging fruit
 * Risk limits per participants that blocks increasing risk when a certain threshold is reached
 * In general clearing is incomplete for now and it only supports loading the instruments
 * COD not implemented - session disconnect doesn't kill the session orders
 * a better mechanism to refresh instruments (clearing, matching engine) instead of the current timed refresh
